Simulate a ucsf (Sparky) file 
=============================


This example shows how to use the
:py:func:`nmrglue.analysis.linesh.sim_NDregion` function to simulate a HSQC
spectrum with peak locations provided by a text file.  The simulated spectrum
is saved as a ucsf (Sparky) file named `test.ucsf`.
