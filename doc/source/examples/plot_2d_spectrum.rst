plotting example: plot_2d_spectrum
==================================

This example shows how to use nmrglue and 
`matplotlib <http://matplotlib.sourceforge.net/index.html>`_ to create figures
for examining data or publication.  In this example a contour plot of the 
spectrum from a 2D NMRPipe file is created.  Slices are added in the 15N and 
13C dimension as well as sample peak labels.  :ref:`plot_2d_spectrum_pts`
is similar to this example but plotted on a point scale.

The data used in this example is available for
