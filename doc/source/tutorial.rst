Introduction
============

nmrglue is a python module for reading, writing, and interacting with the 
spectral data stored in a number of common NMR data formats.  This tutorial 
provides an overview of some of the features of nmrglue.  A basic 
understanding of python is assumed which can be obtained by reading some
of the `python documentation <http://docs.python.org/>`_.  The examples in 
this tutorial can be run interactively from the python shell but the use of an
enhanced python shell which provides non-blocking control of GUI threads, 
for example  `ipython <http://ipython.scipy.org>`_, is 
recommended when trying the examples which use matplotlib.  The sample data
using in this tutorial is 
`available <http://code.google.com/p/nmrglue/downloads/list>`_ is you wish to 
follow along with the same files.


Reading NMR files
=================

nmrglue can read and write to a number of common NMR file formats.  To see 
how simple this can be let's read a 2D NMRPipe file.

    >>> import nmrglue as ng
    >>> dic,data = ng.pipe.read("test.fid")

Here we have imported the ``nmrglue`` module and opened the NMRPipe file 
``test.fid``.  nmrglue contains a number of modules for reading and writing NMR
files and all of these modules have a ``read`` function which opens a file
or directory containing NMR data, reads in any necessary information, and loads 
the spectral data into memory.  The ``read`` function returns a 2-tuple 
containing a python dictionary with file and spectral parameters and a 
`numpy <http://numpy.scipy.org/>`_ array object containing the numeric 
spectral data.  Currently the following file formats are supported by nmrglue
with the associated module:

======  ========================
Module  File Format
======  ========================
bruker  Bruker
pipe    NMRPipe
sparky  Sparky
varian  Varian/Agilent
======  ========================

Examining the data object in more detail:

    >>> data.ndim
    2
    >>> data.shape
    (332, 1500)
    >>> data.dtype
    dtype('complex64')

We can see that this is a two dimensional data set with 1500 complex points
in the direct dimension and 332 points in the indirect dimension.  nmrglue 
takes care of converting the raw data in the file into an array of appropiate 
type, dimensionality, and quadrature.  For complex data the last axis, 
typically the direct dimension, is converted to a complex data type.  The other
axes are not converted.

In some cases, not all of the information needed to represent the spectral data 
as a well formed numpy array is stored in the file, or the values determined 
automatically are incorrect. In many of these cases, this information can be 
specified directly in the function call.

For example, the ``read`` function in the ``varian`` module sometimes cannot 
determine the shape or fid ordering of 3D files correctly.  These parameters 
can be explicitly provided in the function call with the shape and torder
keywords. See :ref:`varian_module` for details.

Universal dictionaries
======================

In addition to the spectral data, the ``read`` function also determines 
various spectral parameters that were stored in the file and stores them in a 
python dictionary:

    
    >>> dic["FDF2SW"]
    50000.0
    >>> dic["FDF1LABEL"]
    '15N'

Here we see NMRPipe files stores the spectal width of the direct dimension 
(50000.0 Hz) and the name of the indirect dimension (15N) as well as a number 
of additional parameters.

Some file formats describe well the spectral data, listing a large number of 
parameters, other only a few.  In addition, different formats express 
parameters in different units and under different names.  For users who are 
familar with the specific file format or are working with only a single file
type, this is not a problem; the dictionary allows direct access to these
parameters. If a more uniform listing of spectal parameters is desired, the
``guess_udic`` function can be used to create a 'universal' dictionary.

    >>> udic = ng.pipe.guess_udic(dic,data)
    >>> udic.keys()
    ['ndim', 0, 1]
    >>>

This 'universal' dictionary of spectral parameters contains only the most
fundamental parameters, the dimensionality of the data, and a dictionary
of parameters for each axis numbered according to the data array ordering 
(the direct dimension is the highest numbered dimension).  The axis
dictionaries contain the following keys:

========    ======================================================
Key         Description
========    ======================================================
car         Carrier frequency in Hz.
complex     True for complex data, False for magnitude data.
encoding    How the data is encoded, 'states', 'tppi', etc.
freq        True for frequency domain data, False for time domain.
label       String descriping the axis name.
obs         Observation frequency in MHz.
size        Dimension size (R|I for last axis, R+I for others)
sw          Spectral width in Hz.
time        True for time domain data, False got frequency domain.
========    ======================================================


For our 2D NMRPipe file, these parameters for the indirect dimension are:

    >>> for k,v in udic[0].iteritems(): print k,v
    ...
    encoding states
    car 6077.75985718
    sw 5555.55615234
    label 15N
    complex True
    time True
    freq False
    obs 50.6479988098
    size 332

One note on the size key, it was designed to always match the shape of the 
data:

    >>> [udic[n]["size"] for n in range(udic["ndim"])]
    [332, 1500]
    >>> data.shape
    (332, 1500)


Not all NMR files formats contain all the information necessary to determine
uniquely all of the universal dictionary parameters.  In these cases, the
dictionary will be filled with generic values (999.99, "X", "Y", etc) and
should be updated by the user with the correct values.
In converting to a 'universal' dictionary we have sacrificed additional 
information about the data which was contained in the original file in order
to provide a common description of NMR data.  Despite the universal 
dictionary's limited information, together with the data array, it is sufficient
for most NMR tasks.  We will later see that the universal dictionary allows
for conversions between file formats.


Manipulating NMR data
=====================

Let us return again to the data array.  By providing direct access to the 
spectral data as a numpy array we can examine and manipulate this data using
a number of simple methods as well as a number of functions.  Since
the ``read`` function moves the data into memory all this data manipulation
is done without effecting the original data file.

We can use slices to examine single values in the array:

    >>> print data[0,0]
    (42.6003+139.717j)

Or an whole vector:

    >>> print data[0]
    [  42.60026550+139.71652222j  360.07470703+223.2023468j
      245.21197510+202.19010925j ...,   -5.77970505 +11.27639675j
        -25.34334183  +0.71600127j    4.61173439  -9.05398846j]

And along the indirect dimension:

    >>> print data[:,0]
    [  4.26002655e+01 +1.39716522e+02j   1.69816299e+02 +9.70676041e+01j
    ...
       6.66494827e+01 -4.79175758e+01j   9.63234711e+00 -1.54378242e+01j]

We can do more advanced slicing:

    >>> print data[2:5,0:10]
    [[  99.46063232+271.79595947j  336.36364746+246.67727661j
    ...
       233.28765869+188.69224548j  280.29260254+227.20960999j]]
    >>> print data[0,::-1]
    [   4.61173439  -9.05398846j  -25.34334183  +0.71600127j
       -5.77970505 +11.27639675j ...,  245.21197510+202.19010925j
         360.07470703+223.2023468j    42.60026550+139.71652222j]

If we just want the real or imaginary channel:

    >>> print data[0,0:2].real
    [  42.6002655   360.07470703]
    >>> print data[0,0:2].imag
    [ 139.71652222  223.2023468 ]

We find characteristics of the data:

    >>> data.min()
    (-161.38414+71.787979j)
    >>> data.max()
    (360.07471+223.20235j)
    >>> data.mean()
    (0.041979135291164656+0.086375666729417669j)
    >>> data.std()
    23.997132358800357
    >>> data.sum()
    (20905.609+43015.082j)

Reshape or transpose the data:

    >>> data.shape
    (332, 1500)
    >>> data.reshape(664,750).shape
    (664, 750)
    >>> data.transpose().shape
    (1500, 332)

Finally we can set the value of data as desired. For example setting a
single point:

    >>> data[0,0] = (100.+100.j)
    >>> data[0,0]
    (100+100j)

Or a region:

    >>> data[1]
    array([ 0.+0.j,  0.+0.j,  0.+0.j, ...,  0.+0.j,  0.+0.j,  0.+0.j], dtype=complex64)
    >>> data[9].imag
    array([ 1.,  1.,  1., ...,  1.,  1.,  1.], dtype=float32)

The `numpy documentation <http://docs.scipy.org/doc/>`_ has additional 
information on the 
`array <http://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/arrays.ndarray.html>`_ 
object.  In addition by combining nmrglue with 
`numpy <http://numpy.scipy.org/>`_ and/or `scipy <http://www.scipy.org/>`_
more complex data manipulation and calculation can be performed.  Later we
will show how these modules are used to create a full suite of processing 
functions.
    

Writing NMR files
=================

Now that we have modified the original NMR data we can write our modification 
to a file.  nmrglue again makes this simple:

    >>> ng.pipe.write("new_data.fid",dic,data)

Reading in both the original data and this new data we can see that they are
different:

    >>> new_dic,new_data = ng.pipe.read("new_data.fid")
    >>> ng.misc.isdatasimilar(orig_data,new_data)
    False
    >>> orig_data[0,0]
    (42.600266+139.71652j)
    >>> new_data[0,0]
    (100+100j)

The parameter dictionary has not changed:

    >>> ng.misc.isdicsimilar(orig_dic,new_dic)
    True

By default nmrglue will not overwrite existing data with the ``write`` 
function:

    >>> ng.pipe.write("new_data.fid",dic,data)
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    IOError: File exists, recall with overwrite=True

But this check can be by-passed with the overwrite parameter:

    >>> ng.pipe.write("new_data.fid",dic,data,overwrite=True)


The unit_conversion object
==========================

Eariler we used the array index values for slicing the numpy array.  For 
reference your data in more common NMR units nmrglue provides the 
``unit_coversion`` object.  Use the ``make_uc`` function to create a 
``unit_conversion`` object:

    >>> dic,data = ng.pipe.read("test.ft2")
    >>> uc0 = ng.pipe.make_uc(dic,data,dim=0)
    >>> uc1 = ng.pipe.make_uc(dic,data,dim=1)

We now have unit conversion objects for both axes in the 2D spectrum.  We can
use these objects to determind the nearest point for a given unit:

    >>> uc0("100.0 ppm")
    1397
    >>> uc1(5000,"Hz")
    2205

Or an exact value:

    >>> uc0.f("23 %")
    470.81
    >>> uc1.f(170,"PPM")
    863.89020937500004

We can also convert from points to various units:

    >>> uc0.ppm(1200)
    110.57355437408664
    >>> uc1.hz(100)
    30692.301979064941
    >>> uc0.unit(768,"percent")
    37.518319491939423

These objects can also be used for slicing, for example to find the trace 
closes to 120 ppm:

    >>> data[uc0("120ppm")]
    array([  534.28442383, -3447.58349609, -5216.93701172, ..., -8258.26171875,
           -8828.359375  , -1102.84863281], dtype=float32)



Converting between file formats
===============================

nmrglue can also be used to convert between file formats using the convert
module.  For example to convert a 2D NMRPipe file to a Sparky file:

    >>> dic,data = ng.pipe.read("test.ft2")
    >>> C = ng.convert.converter()
    >>> C.from_pipe(dic,data)
    >>> sparky_dic,sparky_data = C.to_sparky()
    >>> ng.sparky.write("sparky_file.ucsf",sparky_dic,sparky_data)

Here we opened the NMRPipe file *test.ft2* , created a new ``converter`` object
and loaded it with the NMRPipe data.  The ``converter`` is then used to generate
the Sparky parameter dictionary and a data array appropiate for Sparky data 
which is written to *sparky_file.ucsf*.
All type conversions, and sign manipulation of the data array is performed 
internally by the ``converter`` object.  In addition new dictionaries are 
created from an internal universal dictionary for the desired output.  
Additional examples showing how to use nmrglue to convert between NMR file
formats can be found in the :ref:`convert_examples`.


Low memory reading/writing of files
===================================

Up to this point we have read NMR data from files using the ``read`` function.
This function reads the spectral data from a NMR file into the computers 
memory.  For small data sets this is fine, modern computer have sufficient 
RAM to store complete 1D and 2D NMR data sets and a few copies of the
data while processing.  For 3D and larger dimensionality data set this is often
not desired.  Reading in an entire 3D data set is not required when only a 
small portion must be examined for viewing or processing.  With this in mind
nmrglue provides methods to read only a portions of NMR data from files when
it is required.  This is accomplished by creating a new object which look
very similar to numpy array but does not load data into memory.  
Rather when a particular slice is requested the the object opens the 
necessary file(s), reads in the data and returns to the user a numpy 
array with the data.  In addition these objects have tranpose and swapaxes
method and can be iterated over just as numpy arrays but without using 
large amounts of memory.  The only limitation of these objects is that they 
do not support assignment, so a slice must be taken before changing the value
of data.  The fileio sub-modules all have some form of ``read_lowmem`` 
function which return these low-memory objects.  For example reading the 2D 
sparky file we created earlier:

    >>> dic,data = ng.sparky.read_lowmem("sparky_file.ucsf")
    >>> type(data)
    <class 'nmrglue.fileio.sparky.sparky_2d'>
    >>> data.shape
    (2048, 4096)

Slicing returns a numpy array:

    >>> data[0,1]
    array(1601.8291015625, dtype=float32)
    >>> data[0]
    array([-2287.25195312,  1601.82910156,   475.85516357, ..., -4680.2265625 ,
         -72.70507812, -1402.25256348], dtype=float32)
    
The data can be transposed as a numpy array: 

    >>> tdata = data.transpose()
    >>> type(tdata)
    <class 'nmrglue.fileio.sparky.sparky_2d'>
    >>> tdata.shape
    (4096, 2048)
    >>> tdata[1,0]
    array(1601.8291015625, dtype=float32)

These low memory usage objects can be written to disk or used in to 
load a ``conversion`` object just as if they were normal numpy arrays.

Similar when large data sets are to be written to disk, it often does 
not make sense to write the entire data set at once.  For this the 
``write_lowmem`` functions in the fileIO submodules provide methods for
trace-by-trace or similar writing.


Processing data
===============

With NMR spectral data being stored as a numpy array a number of linear 
algebra and signal processing functions can be applied to the data.  The 
functions in the `numpy <http://numpy.scipy.org/>`_
and `scipy <http://www.scipy.org/>`_ modules offer a number of processing
functions users might find useful.  nmrglue provides a number of common
NMR functions in the :ref:`proc_base` module, baseline related functions
in :ref:`proc_bl`, and linear prediction functions in the :ref:`proc_lp`
module.  For example we perform some simple processing on our 2D NMRPipe file 
(output supressed):

    >>> dic,data = ng.pipe.read("test.fid")
    >>> ng.proc_base.ft(data)
    >>> ng.proc_base.mir_left(data)
    >>> ng.proc_base.neg_left(data)
    >>> ng.proc_bl.sol_sine(data)

These functions process only the data, they do not
update the spectral parameter associated with the data.  Because these
values are key when examining NMR data we want functions which take into 
account these parameter while processing.  nmrglue provides the 
:ref:`pipe_proc` module for processing NMRPipe data while updating the
spectral properties simulatanously.  Additional modules for processing 
other file format are being developed.  Using ``pipe_proc`` is similar to
using NMRPipe itself.  For example to process the sample 2D NMRPipe file:

    >>> dic,data = ng.pipe.read("test.fid")
    >>> dic,data = ng.pipe_proc.sp(dic,data,off=0.35,end=0.98,pow=1,c=1.0)
    >>> dic,data = ng.pipe_proc.zf(dic,data,auto=True)
    >>> dic,data = ng.pipe_proc.ps(dic,data,p0=-29.0,p1=0.0)
    >>> dic,data = ng.pipe_proc.di(dic,data)
    >>> dic,data = ng.pipe_proc.tp(dic,data)
    >>> dic,data = ng.pipe_proc.sp(dic,data,off=0.35,end=0.9,pow=1,c=0.5)
    >>> dic,data = ng.pipe_proc.zf(dic,data,size=2048)
    >>> dic,data = ng.pipe_proc.ft(dic,data,auto=True)
    >>> dic,data = ng.pipe_proc.ps(dic,data,p0=0.0,p1=0.0)
    >>> dic,data = ng.pipe_proc.di(dic,data)
    >>> dic,data = ng.pipe_proc.tp(dic,data)

This processed file can then be written out

    >>> ng.pipe.write("2d_pipe.ft2",dic,data,overwrite=True)

In the example above the entire data set was processed in memory.  All the
processing functions were applied to a set of data stored in the computers
RAM after which the entire 2D data set was written to disk.  For 1D and 2D
data sets this is fine, but as mentioned earlier many 3D and larger data sets
cannot be processed in this manner.  For a 3D file what is desired is that
each 2D XY plane be read, processed and saved.  Then the ZX planes are read
from this new file, the Z plane processed and these planes saved into the 
final file.  In nmrglue this can be accomplished for NMRPipe files using the
:ref:`iter3D object <pipe_iter3D>`.  Currently no other file format allows
such processing but development of these is planned.  
An example of processing a 3D NMRPipe file using a ``iter3D`` object can be 
found in :ref:`process_pipe_3d`.

Additonal examples showing how to use nmrglue to process NMR data can be
found in the :ref:`processing_examples`.


Using matplotlib to create figures
==================================

A number of python plotting libraries exist which can be used in conjunction
with nmrglue to produce publication quality figures.  matplotlib is one of
the more popular libraries and has the ability to output to a number of 
hardcopy formats as well as offering a robust interactive environment.  When
using matplotlib interactively use of `ipython`_
or a similar shell is recommeneded although the standard python shell can be 
used.  For example to create a simple plot of a 1D spectrum (if the ipython
shell is used for this example use the ``-pylab`` switch) :

    >>> import pylab
    >>> dic,data = ng.pipe.read("test.ft")
    >>> pylab.plot(data)
    [<matplotlib.lines.Line2D object at 0x8754fd0>]
    >>> pylab.savefig("plot_1d.png")


Here we have loaded the pylab module from matplotlib and used it to plot the
1D frequency domain data of a model protein.  The resulting figure is saved
as ``plot_1d.png``.

.. image:: plot_1d.png
    :scale: 50

A contour plot of 2D data can created in a similar manner:

    >>> pylab.cla()
    >>> dic,data = ng.pipe.read("test.ft2")
    >>> cl = [30000*1.2**x for x in range(20)]
    >>> pylab.contour(data,cl)
    <matplotlib.contour.ContourSet instance at 0x151e2f80>
    >>> pylab.show()

The ``show()`` method raises an an interactive window for examining the plot:

.. image:: screenshot.jpg
    :scale: 50


matplotlib can be used to create more complicated figures with annotations, ppm
axes and more.  The :ref:`plotting_examples` and :ref:`interactive_examples`
showcase some some of this functionality.  For additional information see the
`matplotlib webpage <http://matplotlib.sourceforge.net/>`_


Additional resources
====================

Detailed information about each module in nmrglue as well as the functions 
provided by that module can be found in the nmrglue :ref:`reference_guide` or
by using Python build in help system:

    >>> help(ng.pipe.read)
    
A number of :ref:`examples-index` using nmrglue to interact with 
NMR data are avilable. Finally documentation for the following packages
might be useful to users of nmrglue:
